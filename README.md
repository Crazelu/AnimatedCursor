# Animated Cursor

This is an implementation of a text editing interface I saw on Twitter that I thought was fun by [@pacocoursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey).
I have adapted my implementation to work for password validation.

Uses: 
- `TextPainter`
- Implicit Flutter Animations
- `AnimationController` and `Animation` Objects
